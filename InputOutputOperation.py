'''
Python provides two built-in functions to read a line of text from standard input, which by default comes from the keyboard. 
These functions are âˆ’

1) raw_input
2) input
'''

#The raw_input([prompt]) function reads one line from standard input and returns it as a string (removing the trailing newline).
# raw_input doesnt work after Python 3.0

>>> str = raw_input("Enter your input: ");
>>> print "Received input is : ", str

#input([prompt]) function is equivalent to raw_input, except that it assumes the input is a valid Python expression and 
#returns the evaluated result to you before python 3.0
#after python 3.0 raw_input has been renamed to input()



#File reading and writing 

'''
in Python, a file operation takes place in the following order.

Open a file
Read or write (perform operation)
Close the file
'''

'''
Before you can read or write a file, you have to open it using Python's built-in open() function. This function creates 
a file object, which would be utilized to call other support methods associated with it.
'''

file object = open(file_name [, access_mode][, buffering])

'''
where file_name = The file_name argument is a string value that contains the name of the file that you want to access, it 
                  includes path as well
                  
access_mode = The access_mode determines the mode in which the file has to be opened, i.e., read, write, append, etc.

buffering = If the buffering value is set to 0, no buffering takes place. If the buffering value is 1, line buffering is 
performed while accessing a file. If you specify the buffering value as an integer greater than 1, then buffering action 
is performed with the indicated buffer size. If negative, the buffer size is the system default(default behavior).

'''

#Different access mode :::

# r => Opens a file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode.


# rb => Opens a file for reading only in binary format. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is 
#the default mode.
       

# r+ => Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file pointer placed at the beginning of the file.


# rb+ => Opens a file for both reading and writing in binary format. The file pointer placed at the beginning of the file.


# w => Opens a file for writing only. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file
#for writing.


# wb => Opens a file for writing only in binary format. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, 
#creates a new file for writing.


# w+ => Opens a file for both writing and reading. Overwrites the existing file if the file exists. If the file does not exist,
#creates a new file for reading and writing.


# wb+ => Opens a file for both writing and reading in binary format. Overwrites the existing file if the file exists. If the 
#file does not exist, creates a new file for reading and writing.

	
# a => Opens a file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the 
#append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.

	
# ab => Opens a file for appending in binary format. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, 
#the file is in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.

	
# a+ => Opens a file for both appending and reading. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. The file
#opens in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing.

	
# ab+ => Opens a file for both appending and reading in binary format. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file 
#exists. The file opens in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing.


>>> file1 = open('/Users/sankar.biswas/Desktop/hello.txt',"r",10)    # the file has to exist
>>> type(file1)
<class '_io.TextIOWrapper'>
>>> file1.read()                                      #once this command has been executed, it will empty the variable 'file1'

# file1 contains ==> 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
>>> file1 = open('/Users/sankar.biswas/Desktop/hello 2.txt',"r",10)
>>> a = list(file1.read().split(','))
>>> a
['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10']

#if you try to write after opening it in 'r' mode.
>>> file1.write('a')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
io.UnsupportedOperation: not writable

>>> file1.close()


# Python Command line arguments
==============================================================================================================================
The Python sys module provides access to any command-line arguments via the sys.argv 

This serves two purposes :: 
sys.argv is the list of command-line arguments.
len(sys.argv) is the number of command-line arguments.

$ cat testing.py
import sys

print(sys.argv)
print('Number of arguments:', len(sys.argv), 'arguments.')
print('Argument List:', str(sys.argv))


$ python testing.py 1 2 3 4 5 
['testing.py', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
Number of arguments: 6 arguments.
Argument List: ['testing.py', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5']

first argument is always script name and it is also being counted in number of arguments	





==============================================================================================================================
#writing something to a file

>>> dataFile = open('/Users/sankar.biswas/Desktop/data.txt', 'w')
>>> dataFile.write("I am in Love")
12
>>> dataFile.close()

#reading and printing a file
>>> reading = open('/Users/sankar.biswas/Desktop/data.txt', 'r')
>>> data = reading.read()
>>> print(data)
I am in Love
>>> data.split(' ')
['I', 'am', 'in', 'Love']
