Running several threads is similar to running several different programs concurrently, but with the following benefits âˆ’

1) Multiple threads within a process share the same data space with the main thread and can therefore share information or communicate 
with each other more easily than if they were separate processes.
2)Threads sometimes called light-weight processes and they do not require much memory overhead; they are cheaper than processes.
