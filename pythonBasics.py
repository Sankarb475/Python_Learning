''' Why python?

==> object-oriented scripting language which has functional programming capability.

software quality ==> readble, coherence, software quality, reusable, maintainability 

Developer productivity ==> lines of code is much less in volume with respect to C++ or Java that is less to type, debug and 
easy maintainability

Program portability ==> with respect to version or OS (linux and windows) doesnt trouble us much when importing the code from
one OS to another

Support libraries ==> self-explanatory 

Downside ==> a bit slower than other low level language like C or C++

---a general-purpose language, Pythonâ€™s roles are virtually unlimited: you can use it for everything from website development 
and gaming to robotics and spacecraft control
